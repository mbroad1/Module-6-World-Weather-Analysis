# Module 6 Challenge: World Weather Analysis

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create an app that allows users to find vacation spots based on an input of minimum and maximum temperature in Fahrenheit. Weather data was first retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API and locations of nearby hotel were retrieved using the Google Maps API. Additionally, a route of four close-by cities with the input temperature of the user was created using the GoogleMaps API.
